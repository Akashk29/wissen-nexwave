  	 ---------------------
  	 
  	 why we need ?
  	 
  	 => It is a way of logically grouping classes that are only used in one place
  	 => It increases encapsulation
  	 => It can lead to more readable and maintainable code
  	 
  	 
  	 types:
  	 
  	 - non-static inner-class
  	 - static inner-class
  	 - local
  	 - anonymous inner class
